MatLab/Fortran Interface for DOTLRTv1.0

All Fortran and Matlab files are contained in the directory "MatLab Interface DOTLRTv1.0".
You should be able to go to step (3) and execute. Steps (1) and (2) should be necessary
only when making changes in code, which requires recompiling.

(1)"mrt.dsw"             - compile Fortran routines for "mex_mrt.dll"
Fortran files are compiled using this workspace "mrt.dsw" with COMPAQ Fortran. Once these
are compiled the "obj" and "mod" files are copied from Release sub-directory to main directory
"MatLab Interface DOTLRTv1.0".

(2)"mex_matlab_mrt.m"    - build "mex_mrt.dll" using "mex_mrt.f90", the gateway routine
                            to the driver "mrt" for rt solution
The DLL "mex_mrt.dll" is built using the Matlab script "mex_matlab_mrt.m". In a MatLab
command window and in the directory "MatLab Interface DOTLRTv1.0", the command
">> mex_matlab_mrt" builds the DLL using the gateway routine in Fortran file "mex_mrt.f90"
and other Fortran files from "DOTLRTv1.0".

(3)"matlab_mrt_raob.m"   - read raob data and perform rt solution using "mex_mrt.dll"
Boba Stankov provided all the Matlab code to read raob data. This script "matlab_mrt_raqob.m"
calls the DLL after establishing instrument and atmosphere parameters (bottom of the
script). Notes are included just before calling DLL.

The returned quantities are:

Tb[jz,jud,jpol] = brightness temperature profile at observation angle
    jz = 1 ... nz+1    at levels   atm_inp_altitude(jz-1)  (first level at surface)
    jud  = 1 (upwelling), 2 (downwelling)
    jpol = 1 (horizontal), 2 (vertical)

dTb_dT(jz,jud,jpol), dTb_dp(1:nz,jud,jpol), dTb_dq(1:nz,jud,jpol), dTb_dw(1:nz,jhyd,jud,jpol)
     = Jacobian for observation level at observation angle
    jz = 1, nz   at levels     atm_inp_altitude(jz)
    jhyd  = 1 ... rnum_hydro_phases
     jud  = 1 (upwelling), 2 (downwelling)
     jpol = 1 (horizontal), 2 (vertical)

Tbo(jud,jpol) = brightness temperature for observation level at observation angle
     jud  = 1 (upwelling), 2 (downwelling)
    jpol = 1 (horizontal), 2 (vertical)

opacity(jud) = opacity for observation level at observation angle
     jud  = 1 (upwelling), 2 (downwelling)
NOTE: opacity has no content yet. This is placeholder. Need to finish testing.
